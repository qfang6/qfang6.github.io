Hi everyone, welcome to Qi's ReadMe, my personal blog.

###### About Me
I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at IQVIA, specializing in natural language processing. I hold a master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania, while my undergraduate degree is in Biomedical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology.

###### Why I Switched My Major
As you can probably infer from this blog’s title, I’m a computer scientist by training. While I am content with my undergraduate education, I find tangible and fast-moving computer science projects enthralling. Well, that’s what I told others. I realized I’m good at coding, so I switched. 


The computer science field also fits my personal narrative better. One of my life-time goals is to show there’s much more to pre-established perceptions than first believed, such as how a typical Asian with a typical career in the technology field turns out to be much more. Isn’t it exciting to find the unexpected out of the presumed mundane?

###### Reasons for Starting a Blog
While working on my side projects, I stumbled upon some exceptional personal blogs. One that stands out to me is Jay Alammar’s *Visualizing A Neural Machine Translation Model*. Even after I read countless posts and tutorials alike, the key, value, and query concepts of the Attention Network model always puzzled me, but Jay’s ability to reify the model totally saved my day. I wish I could eventually articulate concepts and ideas in such a clear and meticulous way.


In addition, writing antagonizes me. It was Sunday night, Dalian (Liaoning-China), me, a 15-year-old boy restocking his bookshelf and reorganizing his wallet, hiding from his grim reality, an 800-character essay lurking Monday morning. If I thought those nights were dreadful, it only worsened when I came to America. Because, Ewww, I had to write in English! But there’s no hiding from the fear of writing, so I decided to make a blog. Let the looming long nights begin!
